# IOT-Based-Fault-Detection-of-Underground-Cables-through-Node-MCU-Module
Real time research project

The rapid advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers innovative solutions to traditional challenges. One such challenge is the detection and localization of faults in underground cables, which are crucial for maintaining reliable power distribution and telecommunication networks. This project presents an IoT-based fault detection system utilizing the Node MCU module. The proposed system aims to automate the fault detection process, providing real-time monitoring and precise fault localization to minimize downtime and maintenance costs. In this system, switches placed at known intervals along the cable simulate faults, and sensors measure voltage variations across series resistors representing the cable length. The Node MCU connects to the internet, allowing the collected data to be transmitted to a remote server for real-time monitoring. An LCD display and buzzer provide immediate fault notifications on-site, while LEDs indicate the status and location of faults. The integration of Google Database further enhances the system by storing and retrieving fault data for analysis and reporting.
